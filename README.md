# simple-crypt

A very very simple ClojureScript + Reagent application playing with encryption in the browser through ClojureScript. It randomly generates a key and encrypts (then decrypts) the content of an input with it.

Literally 20 minutes of testing, but I thought I'd put it out there as an example for others anyway. Use `lein figwheel` to run the development server.
